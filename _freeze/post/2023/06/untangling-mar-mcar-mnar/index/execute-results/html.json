Correctly analysing datasets that have missing data requires extra care and consideration to produce correct results.\n\nThe best method for dealing with missing data depends on the underlying process causing the missingness. There is no single approach that is always the best, and the terminology commonly used to describe missingness doesn't directly relate to what analysis methods perform best. In this blog post I'll explain how to describe missing data processes using causal diagrams (DAGs) and provide some references to help choose an analysis based on that.\n\n![(original image via [\\@marginoferror on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marginoferror/status/935937659888836609), adapted by me for missing data purposes.)](dont_fight_a_cat_MI.jpeg)\n\n## MCAR, MAR, MNAR or nah?\n\nThe most common classification for missing data mechanisms is as either Missing Completely at Random (MCAR), Missing at Random (MAR), or Missing Not at Random (MNAR). This classification is based on concepts first introduced in @rubin_inference_1976. These terms are widespread, but can be confusing when first encountered because they do not mean quite what you might expect them to mean.\n\nData is considered to be **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)** if the probability of being missing does not depend on the values of any of the variables in the data, whether those values are missing or observed [@little_statistical_2014, p. 12]. In other words, the missingness cannot be related to the research question of interest [@lee_framework_2021].\n\nData is  **Missing at Random (MAR)** if the probability of being missing depends only on data that was observed [@little_statistical_2014, p. 12]. This term is misleading if encountered without context, as a plain-language interpretation suggests it may mean something more like MCAR. However, MCAR is a stricter condition than MAR. In other words, if data is MCAR, it is also considered MAR. There are a few subtly different ways of defining this concept mathematically; @seaman_what_2013 goes into the detail for those who are interested.\n\nData is **Missing Not at Random (MNAR)** if it's not Missing at Random  [@little_statistical_2014, p. 12]. At least that's relatively straightforward. In other words, the probability of data being missing is related to what the missing values would have been, had we observed them. It is often implied that MNAR data is a lost cause for statistical analysis, but later in this post we will see specific examples of MNAR where common statistical procedures produce valid results for common questions.\n\nWhether data is classified as MAR or MNAR depends on more than just the variables with missing data. It also depends on the availability of additional variables in the dataset which may be able to explain the probability of missingness.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Historical aside\n@rubin_inference_1976 is often cited as the source of this classification system, but didn't actually introduce the terms Missing Completely at Random or Missing Not at Random, only Missing at Random. Rubin originally defined an additional condition, Observed at Random. Data which is both Missing at Random and Observed at Random is what we would now commonly refer to as Missing Completely at Random. The term Missing Completely at Random came later, in @marini_maximum-likelihood_1980. This history is given in @little_missing_2021 and was also confirmed [in a Tweet by Raphael Nishimura](https://twitter.com/rnishimura/status/1668824406766878721): 'I was curious about that too and did some digging with the authors. Rod said that \"Rubin's 1976 Biometrika paper defines MAR and OAR (observed at random) but he may not have put the two together.\" Don confirmed it and added that \"MCAR was first formally defined in a joint paper with Marini and Olsen, I think in 1980, in a more applied paper.\"'\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n## Ignorable and non-ignorable missingness\nSometimes you may hear missing data described as \"ignorable\" or \"non-ignorable\". These terms are also potentially misleading. \"Ignorable\" missing data doesn't mean that you can just ignore the fact that you have missing data when doing an analysis. This term was defined in @rubin_inference_1976 to mean that (1) the data is MAR; (2) the likelihood can be factorised into a part relating to the missingness probability and a part relating to the distribution of the underlying data. These provide a sufficient condition for missing data to be dealt with using likelihood-based methods.\n:::\n\n### How do I know what kind of missing data mechanism I have?\n\nUnfortunately, there's no way to determine the missing data mechanism purely by looking at the data --- you need to think about the process generating the data and why some of it is missing. A causal DAG is a good way to reason about the relationship between the variables and their reasons for being missing and can help you decide what analysis to use. I'll have examples of this later in this blog.\n\n### If I know my missing data mechanism, what analysis should I do?\n\nIt depends! (I'm statistician, you should have known I would say that.)\n\nComplete cases analysis is unbiased if the data is MCAR. This is a sufficient condition, not a necessary condition [@little_missing_2021]: there are situations where complete cases may be valid, or at least provide a valid estimate of a particular quantity of interest, under MAR or MNAR. Depending on the amount of missing data, complete cases analysis may be inefficient (i.e., have lower power than other methods) because only cases where no variables have missing values are used in the analysis.\n\nMultiple imputation, likelihood-based methods and full Bayesian methods are unbiased if the data is MAR or MCAR [@little_missing_2021]. Multiple imputation is approximately equivalent to a maximum-likelihood method if the underlying model is the same [@collins_comparison_2001].\n\nIn some specific MNAR situations, either or both of the above methods may still be valid, depending on what you're trying to estimate [@white_bias_2010].\n\n## Making the missing data process explicit using causal diagrams (DAGs)\n\nCausal diagrams are used to represent causal relationships between variables in a study [@pearl_causal_1995]. These relationships are shown visually using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is a mathematical term for a bunch of circles with arrows between them. The circles (nodes) represent variables and arrows (edges) between them represent direct causal pathways. The direction of the arrows represents the direction of causation, and a valid DAG never has a path leading from a particular point back to that same point (a \"cycle\" in mathematician-speak). If there is no path following the arrows between two variables in a DAG, there is no causal connection between them.\n\nThe structure of the DAG behind your data cannot be inferred just from looking at the data. It needs to come from substantive expertise about the underlying variables in the data, their relationship to each other, and how the data was collected.\n\nThe idea of using a DAG to represent missing data assumptions was first introduced in @mohan_graphical_2014. To provide more practical advice for specific scenarios, @moreno-betancur_canonical_2018 introduces \"canonical\" causal diagrams for missing data in the setting where we want to estimate the relationship between an outcome *Y* and an exposure *X* (that's epidemiologist-speak for the main predictor of interest), adjusting for some confounding variables which may influence both the outcome and the exposure. The confounding variables may be either completely observed (*Z1*) or have some missing data (*Z2*). There may also be some unknown, unmeasured factors *U* which affect the exposure and the confounders.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code below plots the DAG corresponding to the scenario above using the R packages [*dagitty*](http://www.dagitty.net/) [@textor_robust_2017] and [*ggdag*](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggdag). You don't need to understand the R code to use and apply DAGs but it is provided as an example for those who may want to make causal diagrams for their own studies. The first part of the code describes the underlying relationships between the variables, using the same syntax used to describe regression models in R. The second part of the code sets up the visual coordinates used for plotting the DAG --- an aesthetic consideration only.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndag_nomiss <- dagify(\n  Y ~ X + Z1 + Z2,\n  X ~ Z1 + Z2 + U,\n  Z1 ~ U,\n  Z2 ~ U,\n  coords = list(\n    x = c(U = 0, Z1 = 1, Z2 = 1, X = 2, Y = 3),\n    y = c(U = 0, Z1 = 1, Z2 = -1, X = 0, Y = 0)\n  )\n)\nggdag(dag_nomiss) + theme_dag()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/dag-nomiss-1.png){width=1170}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis DAG is called a complete-data DAG, or *c-DAG*. It represents the causal relationships between the variables if all of them had been completely observed.\n\nTo represent possible causes of missing data, we can introduce three new variables in the DAG: *MX*, *MY* and *MZ2*, representing whether or not the exposure (*X*), outcome (*Y*), or partially-observed confounders (*Z2*) are missing. Adding these variables produces a missingness DAG, or *m-DAG*. @moreno-betancur_canonical_2018 also considers unmeasured causes of missingness (*W*) which are not related to any of the substantive variables in the study but do affect the probability of missingness.\n\nIf we turn the c-DAG above into an m-DAG by adding nodes for *MX*, *MY*, and *MZ2* but no additional arrows, the absence of arrows to *MX*, *MY* and *MZ2* would mean that there is no causal relationship between any of the variables and their missingness. In other words, the c-DAG is the m-DAG for MCAR. This scenario would be quite unusual in most real studies, unless the missing data was deliberately planned.\n\nFigure 2 in @moreno-betancur_canonical_2018 provides 10 examples of m-DAGs, with different combinations of the following features:\n\n- incomplete confounders and exposure related to missingness of other variables;\n- incomplete confounders and exposure related to their own missingness;\n- outcome related to missingness of other variables; and\n- outcome related to its own missingness.\n\nThe first of these canonical DAGs, m-DAG A, is an example of a MAR process, where the missingness is only related to completely-observed confounders (*Z1*) and unmeasured variables unrelated to other variables in the study (*W*). We can visualise that DAG using the code below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndag_a <- dagify(\n  Y ~ X + Z1 + Z2,\n  X ~ Z1 + Z2 + U,\n  Z1 ~ U,\n  Z2 ~ U,\n  MX ~ Z1 + W,\n  MY ~ Z1 + W,\n  MZ2 ~ Z1 + W,\n  coords = list(\n    x = c(U = 0, Z1 = 1, Z2 = 1, X = 2, Y = 3,\n          MX = 1.5, MY = 2, MZ2 = 2.5, W = 2),\n    y = c(U = 0, Z1 = 0.75, Z2 = -0.75, X = 0, Y = 0,\n          MX = 1.75, MY = 1.75, MZ2 = 1.75, W = 2.5)\n  )\n)\nggdag(dag_a) + theme_dag()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/dag-a-1.png){width=1170}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this DAG, so long as the model's adjustment for confounders is correctly specified (a big \"if\"!), both complete cases analysis and multiple imputation provide valid estimates of not just the relationship between the exposure and the outcome, but also the complete distribution of the outcome. This isn't something that should be obvious just from looking at the DAG --- there's a derivation in the supplementary materials for @moreno-betancur_canonical_2018 for this and the other DAGs, with the results summarised in Tables 1 and 2 of that paper. Those who are familiar with causal DAGs may want to know that when there is missing data, this derivation is more complex than rules like \"d-separation\" and cannot be done algorithmically.\n\nIn other missing data situations, it may be possible to obtain the effect of the exposure but not, for example, the population mean of the outcome. In some situations, it may not be possible to obtain a valid estimate of either.\n\nThe figure below shows m-DAG E, which is an example of a MNAR process. The probability of missingness in all variables is affected by both the exposure *X* (which may itself have missing values) and partially-observed confounders *Z2*. Perhaps surprisingly, even though this missingness process is MNAR, it is possible to obtain a valid estimate of the relationship between the exposure and the outcome using either complete cases analysis or multiple imputation. However, it is not possible to recover the overall mean of the outcome.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndag_e <- dagify(\n  Y ~ X + Z1 + Z2,\n  X ~ Z1 + Z2 + U,\n  Z1 ~ U,\n  Z2 ~ U,\n  MX ~ Z1 + Z2 + X + W,\n  MY ~ Z1 + Z2 + X + W,\n  MZ2 ~ Z1 + Z2 + X + W,\n  coords = list(\n    x = c(U = 0, Z1 = 1, Z2 = 1, X = 2, Y = 3,\n          MX = 1.5, MY = 2, MZ2 = 2.5, W = 2),\n    y = c(U = 0, Z1 = 0.75, Z2 = -0.75, X = 0, Y = 0,\n          MX = 1.75, MY = 1.75, MZ2 = 1.75, W = 2.5)\n  )\n)\nggdag(dag_e) + theme_dag()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/dag-e-1.png){width=1170}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe final example in this blog is m-DAG J, which is another MNAR process. In this example, missingness is also affected by the value of the outcome *Y*. For this m-DAG, it is not possible to recover the relationship between the outcome and the exposure.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndag_j <- dagify(\n  Y ~ X + Z1 + Z2,\n  X ~ Z1 + Z2 + U,\n  Z1 ~ U,\n  Z2 ~ U,\n  MX ~ Z1 + Z2 + X + Y + W,\n  MY ~ Z1 + Z2 + X + Y + W,\n  MZ2 ~ Z1 + Z2 + X + Y + W,\n  coords = list(\n    x = c(U = 0, Z1 = 1, Z2 = 1, X = 2, Y = 3,\n          MX = 1.5, MY = 2, MZ2 = 2.5, W = 2),\n    y = c(U = 0, Z1 = 0.75, Z2 = -0.75, X = 0, Y = 0,\n          MX = 1.75, MY = 1.75, MZ2 = 1.75, W = 2.5)\n  )\n)\nggdag(dag_j) + theme_dag()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/dag-j-1.png){width=1170}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you have an m-DAG where a quantity of interest cannot be recovered, you can consider doing a sensitivity analysis using a $\\delta$-adjustment. This process is described in popular texts on missing data, e.g. @van_buuren_flexible_2018 sec 9.2 (also [available online](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/sec-sensitivity.html)) or @molenberghs_handbook_2015.\n\n## Applying DAGs to real missing data problems\n\nStart by drawing a DAG representing the causal relationships between your variables and their possible reasons for being missing. This will require some thinking about which arrows are plausible and which are not, based on your understanding of the real-world relationships between variables and the way the data has been collected.\n\nOnce you've drawn a DAG for your study, you can compare it to the canonical DAGs in @moreno-betancur_canonical_2018. For canonical DAGs A, B, D and E, complete cases analysis was shown to provide a valid estimate of the relationship between the outcome and the exposure. For canonical DAGs A, B, C, D and E, multiple imputation was shown to provide a valid estimate of the relationship between the outcome and the exposure. @lee_assumptions_2023 provides further practical guidance for data analysis using missingness DAGs.\n\n@white_bias_2010 considers some scenarios where covariates are missing and compares complete cases and multiple imputation. In some scenarios, complete cases analysis was unbiased while multiple imputation was not; in other scenarios, the reverse was true.\n\nRandomised clinical trials provide some additional guarantees about the nature of the missing data process which observational studies do not: the exposure is completely observed and known to be unrelated to baseline covariates. @sullivan_should_2018 considers several methods for dealing with missing data in randomised trials.\n\nThe papers above provide examples of situations where multiple imputation is not necessarily better than simpler methods, as well as situations where multiple imputation is required. The situations where particular missing data methods work do not neatly align with the definitions of MCAR/MAR/MNAR but by drawing a DAG and considering the results in the papers above you should be able to determine which popular methods are applicable for your data and research question.\n\n::: {style=\"font-size:80%\"}\nThanks to Lachlan Cribb for providing feedback which improved this blog post.\n:::\n\n## References\n",
