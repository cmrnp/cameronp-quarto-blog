	abstract = {The use of multiple imputation has increased markedly in recent years, and journal reviewers may expect to see multiple imputation used to handle missing data. However in randomized trials, where treatment group is always observed and independent of baseline covariates, other approaches may be preferable. Using data simulation we evaluated multiple imputation, performed both overall and separately by randomized group, across a range of commonly encountered scenarios. We considered both missing outcome and missing baseline data, with missing outcome data induced under missing at random mechanisms. Provided the analysis model was correctly specified, multiple imputation produced unbiased treatment effect estimates, but alternative unbiased approaches were often more efficient. When the analysis model overlooked an interaction effect involving randomized group, multiple imputation produced biased estimates of the average treatment effect when applied to missing outcome data, unless imputation was performed separately by randomized group. Based on these results, we conclude that multiple imputation should not be seen as the only acceptable way to handle missing data in randomized trials. In settings where multiple imputation is adopted, we recommend that imputation is carried out separately by randomized group.},

              Background
              Missing data are unavoidable in epidemiological research, potentially leading to bias and loss of precision. Multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete case analysis (CCA). However, contrary to widespread belief, CCA is preferable to MI in some situations.
            
            
              Methods
              We provide guidance on choice of analysis when data are incomplete. Using causal diagrams to depict missingness mechanisms, we describe when CCA will not be biased by missing data and compare MI and CCA, with respect to bias and efficiency, in a range of missing data situations. We illustrate selection of an appropriate method in practice.
            
            
              Results
              For most regression models, CCA gives unbiased results when the chance of being a complete case does not depend on the outcome after taking the covariates into consideration, which includes situations where data are missing not at random. Consequently, there are situations in which CCA analyses are unbiased while MI analyses, assuming missing at random (MAR), are biased. By contrast MI, unlike CCA, is valid for all MAR situations and has the potential to use information contained in the incomplete cases and auxiliary variables to reduce bias and/or improve precision. For this reason, MI was preferred over CCA in our real data example.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Choice of method for dealing with missing data is crucial for validity of conclusions, and should be based on careful consideration of the reasons for the missing data, missing data patterns and the availability of auxiliary information.},

The latter can be depicted by adding variable-specific missingness indicators to causal diagrams, creating "missingness-directed acyclic graphs" (m-DAGs). Previous research described ten canonical m-DAGs, representing typical multivariable missingness mechanisms in epidemiological studies, and determined the recoverability of the ACE in the absence of effect modification. We extend the research by determining the recoverability of the ACE in settings with effect modification and conducting a simulation study evaluating the performance of widely used missing data methods when estimating the ACE using correctly specified g-computation, which has not been previously studied. Methods assessed were complete case analysis (CCA) and various multiple imputation (MI) implementations regarding the degree of compatibility with the outcome model used in g-computation. Simulations were based on an example from the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study (VAHCS), where interest was in estimating the ACE of adolescent cannabis use on mental health in young adulthood. In the canonical m-DAGs that excluded unmeasured common causes of missingness indicators, we derived the recoverable ACE if no incomplete variable causes its missingness, and non-recoverable otherwise. Besides, the simulation showed that compatible MI approaches may enable approximately unbiased ACE estimation, unless the outcome causes its missingness or it causes the missingness of a variable that causes its missingness. Researchers must consider sensitivity analysis methods incorporating external information in the latter setting. The VAHCS case study illustrates the practical implications of these findings.},

            Researchers faced with incomplete data are encouraged to consider whether their data are ‘missing completely at random’ (MCAR), ‘missing at random’ (MAR) or ‘missing not at random’ (MNAR) when planning their analysis. However, there are two major problems with this classification as originally defined by Rubin in the 1970s. First, when there are missing data in multiple variables, the plausibility of the MAR assumption is difficult to assess using substantive knowledge and is more stringent than is generally appreciated. Second, although MCAR and MAR are sufficient conditions for consistent estimation with specific methods, they are not necessary conditions and therefore this categorization does not directly determine the best approach for handling the missing data in an analysis. How best to handle missing data depends on the assumed causal relationships between variables and their missingness, and what these relationships imply in terms of the ‘recoverability’ of the target estimand (the population parameter that encodes the answer to the underlying research question). Recoverability is defined as whether the estimand can be consistently estimated from the patterns and associations in the observed data without needing to invoke external information on the extent to which the distribution of missing values might differ from that of observed values. In this manuscript we outline an approach for deciding which method to use to handle multivariable missing data in an analysis, using directed acyclic graphs to depict missingness assumptions and determining the implications in terms of recoverability of the target estimand.},

I describe Rubin's original definition of missing at random (MAR), its motivation and criticisms, and his sufficient conditions for ignoring the missingness mechanism for likelihood-based, Bayesian, and frequentist inference. Related definitions, including missing completely at random, always MAR, always missing completely at random, and partially MAR, are also covered. I present a formal argument for weakening Rubin's sufficient conditions for frequentist maximum likelihood inference with precision based on the observed information. Some simple examples of MAR are described, together with an example where the missingness mechanism can be ignored even though MAR does not hold. Alternative approaches to statistical inference based on the likelihood function are reviewed, along with non-likelihood frequentist approaches, including weighted generalized estimating equations. Connections with the causal inference literature are also discussed. Finally, alternatives to Rubin's MAR definition are discussed, including informative missingness, informative censoring, and coarsening at random. The intent is to provide a relatively nontechnical discussion, although some of the underlying issues are challenging and touch on fundamental questions of statistical inference.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent advances in missing data research using graphical models to represent multivariate dependencies. We first examine the limitations of traditional frameworks from three different perspectives: {\textbackslash}textit\{transparency, estimability and testability\}. We then show how procedures based on graphical models can overcome these limitations and provide meaningful performance guarantees even when data are Missing Not At Random (MNAR). In particular, we identify conditions that guarantee consistent estimation in broad categories of missing data problems, and derive procedures for implementing this estimation. Finally we derive testable implications for missing data models in both MAR (Missing At Random) and MNAR categories.},

	title = {Graphical {Models} for {Recovering} {Probabilistic} and {Causal} {Queries} from {Missing} {Data}},
	abstract = {We address the problem of deciding whether a causal or probabilistic query is estimable from data corrupted by missing entries, given a model of miss-ingness process. We extend the results of Mohan et al. [2013] by presenting more general conditions for recovering probabilistic queries of the form P(y{\textbar}x) and P(y, x) as well as causal queries of the form P(y{\textbar}do(x)). We show that causal queries may be recoverable even when the factors in their identifying estimands are not recoverable. Specifically, we derive graphical conditions for recovering causal effects of the form P(y{\textbar}do(x)) when Y and its missingness mechanism are not d-separable. Finally, we apply our results to problems of attrition and characterize the recovery of causal effects from data corrupted by attrition.},
