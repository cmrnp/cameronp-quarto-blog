    "Preface This book is intended to have three roles and to serve three
    associated audiences: an introductory text on Bayesian inference starting
    from first principles, a graduate text on effective current approaches to
    Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields, and a
    handbook of Bayesian methods in applied statistics for general users of and
    researchers in applied statistics. Although introductory in its early
    sections, the book is definitely not elementary in the sense of a first text
    in statistics. The mathematics used in our book is basic probability and
    statistics, elementary calculus, and linear algebra. A review of probability
    notation is given in Chapter 1 along with a more detailed list of topics
    assumed to have been studied. The practical orientation of the book means
    that the reader's previous experience in probability, statistics, and linear
    algebra should ideally have included strong computational components. To
    write an introductory text alone would leave many readers with only a taste
    of the conceptual elements but no guidance for venturing into genuine
    practical applications, beyond those where Bayesian methods agree
    essentially with standard non-Bayesian analyses. On the other hand, we feel
    it would be a mistake to present the advanced methods without first
    introducing the basic concepts from our data-analytic perspective.
    Furthermore, due to the nature of applied statistics, a text on current
    Bayesian methodology would be incomplete without a variety of worked
    examples drawn from real applications. To avoid cluttering the main
    narrative, there are bibliographic notes at the end of each chapter and
    references at the end of the book"--

    The goal of multiple imputation is to provide valid inferences for
    statistical estimates from incomplete data. To achieve that goal, imputed
    values should preserve the structure in the data, as well as the uncertainty
    about this structure, and include any knowledge about the process that
    generated the missing data. Two approaches for imputing multivariate data
    exist: joint modeling (JM) and fully conditional specification (FCS). JM is
    based on parametric statistical theory, and leads to imputation procedures
    whose statistical properties are known. JM is theoretically sound, but the
    joint model may lack flexibility needed to represent typical data features,
    potentially leading to bias. FCS is a semi-parametric and flexible
    alternative that specifies the multivariate model by a series of conditional
    models, one for each incomplete variable. FCS provides tremendous
    flexibility and is easy to apply, but its statistical properties are
    difficult to establish. Simulation work shows that FCS behaves very well in
    the cases studied. The present paper reviews and compares the approaches. JM
    and FCS were applied to pubertal development data of 3801 Dutch girls that
    had missing data on menarche (two categories), breast development (five
    categories) and pubic hair development (six stages). Imputations for these
    data were created under two models: a multivariate normal model with
    rounding and a conditionally specified discrete model. The JM approach
    introduced biases in the reference curves, whereas FCS did not. The paper
    concludes that FCS is a useful and easily applied flexible alternative to JM
    when no convenient and realistic joint distribution can be specified.
