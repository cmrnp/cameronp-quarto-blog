  abstract: >-
    In the 1958 paper "Shall we count the living or the dead?", Mindel C. Sheps
    proposed a principled solution to the familiar problem of asymmetry of the
    relative risk. We provide causal models to clarify the scope and limitations
    of Sheps' line of reasoning, and show that her preferred variant of the
    relative risk will be stable between patient groups under certain
    biologically interpretable conditions. Such stability is useful when
    findings from an intervention study must be generalized to support clinical
    decisions in patients whose risk profile differs from the participants in
    the study. We show that Sheps' approach is consistent with a substantial
    body of psychological and philosophical research on how human reasoners
    carry causal information from one context to another, and that it can be
    implemented in practice using van der Laan et al's Switch Relative Risk, or
    equivalently, using Baker and Jackson's Generalized Relative Risk Reduction
    (GRRR).

    Abstract
                
                  Background
                  It has long been advised to account for baseline covariates in the analysis of confirmatory randomised trials, with the main statistical justifications being that this increases power and, when a randomisation scheme balanced covariates, permits a valid estimate of experimental error. There are various methods available to account for covariates but it is not clear how to choose among them.
                
                
                  Methods
                  Taking the perspective of writing a statistical analysis plan, we consider how to choose between the three most promising broad approaches: direct adjustment, standardisation and inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting.
                
                
                  Results
                  
                    The three approaches are similar in being asymptotically efficient, in losing efficiency with mis-specified covariate functions and in handling designed balance. If a marginal estimand is targeted (for example, a risk difference or survival difference), then direct adjustment should be avoided because it involves fitting non-standard models that are subject to convergence issues. Convergence is most likely with IPTW. Robust standard errors used by IPTW are anti-conservative at small sample sizes. All approaches can use similar methods to handle missing covariate data. With missing outcome data, each method has its own way to estimate a treatment effect in the all-randomised population. We illustrate some issues in a reanalysis of
                    GetTested
                    , a randomised trial designed to assess the effectiveness of an electonic sexually transmitted infection testing and results service.
                  
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  No single approach is always best: the choice will depend on the trial context. We encourage trialists to consider all three methods more routinely.

  abstract: >-
    Psychological theories often invoke interactions but remain vague regarding
    the details. As a consequence, researchers may not know how to properly test
    them and may potentially run analyses that reliably return the wrong answer
    to their research question. We discuss three major issues regarding the
    prediction and interpretation of interactions. First, interactions can be
    removable in the sense that they appear or disappear depending on scaling
    decisions, with consequences for a variety of situations (e.g., binary or
    categorical outcomes, bounded scales with floor and ceiling effects).
    Second, interactions may be conceptualized as changes in slope or changes in
    correlations, and because these two phenomena do not necessarily coincide,
    researchers might draw wrong conclusions. Third, interactions may or may not
    be causally identified, and this determines which interpretations are valid.
    Researchers who remain unaware of these distinctions might accidentally
    analyze their data in a manner that returns the technically correct answer
    to the wrong question. We illustrate all issues with examples from
    psychology and issue recommendations for how to best address them in a
    productive manner.

  abstract: >-
    Covariate adjustment has the potential to increase power in the analysis of
    randomised trials, but mis-specification of the adjustment model could cause
    error. We explore what error is possible when the adjustment model omits a
    covariate by randomised treatment interaction, in a setting where the
    covariate is perfectly balanced between randomised treatments. We use
    mathematical arguments and analyses of single hypothetical data sets. We
    show that analysis by a generalised linear model with the canonical link
    function leads to no error under the null -- that is, if treatment effect is
    truly zero under the adjusted model then it is also zero under the
    unadjusted model. However, using non-canonical link functions does not give
    this property and leads to potentially important error under the null. The
    error is present even in large samples and hence constitutes bias. We
    conclude that covariate adjustment analyses of randomised trials should
    avoid non-canonical links. If a marginal risk difference is the target of
    estimation then this should not be estimated using an identity link;
    alternative preferable methods include standardisation and inverse
    probability of treatment weighting.
